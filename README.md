## üíª System Requirements

Before you can start on your theme, you first need a way to run a LAMP/LEMP (Linux, Apache/nginx, MySQL, PHP) stack on your machine.

We recommend our very own Docker setup called Ups Dock. To install it follow these steps:

1. Install [Docker for Mac](https://www.docker.com/docker-mac)

2. Install [Ups Dock](https://github.com/upstatement/ups-dock) by following the installation steps in the [README](https://github.com/upstatement/ups-dock#installation)

## üõ† Installation

1. Ensure [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) are installed globally.

2. Run `nvm install` to ensure you're using the correct version of Node.

3. If you're _not_ using Ups Dock, you can stop here! Otherwise...

4. Duplicate the contents of `.env.sample` into a new `.env` file

   If you **do not want to use Ups Dock**, change the `COMPOSE_FILE` line in your `.env` to be:

   ```shell
   COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml
   ```

   **TIP:** To prevent build errors, make sure there are no commented out lines including the `COMPOSE_FILE` variable in your `.env` file.

### Option 1: Contributing to Skela

1. If you're installing this repository to contribute to Skela, all you need to do next is run the install command

   ```sh
   ./bin/install
   ```

2. Once the install script succeeds, fire up your site with the start command

   ```sh
   ./bin/start
   ```

   Now you should be able to access your WordPress site on [`ups.dock`](http://ups.dock)!

   The default credentials for WP admin are `admin` / `password` (configurable via `docker-compose.yml`)

### Option 2: Using Skela as a template for another project

If you're using Skela as a template for another project, there's a few more steps to go through in order to set up the project to use your desired theme name.

1. Run the rename theme command and follow the prompt, which will set up the project with your desired theme name

   ```shell
   ./bin/rename-theme
   ```

2. In `package.json` and `composer.json`, update repository and author information

3. Run the install command

   ```shell
   ./bin/install
   ```

4. Once the installation script has finished, run the start command

   ```shell
   ./bin/start
   ```

5. In another terminal tab, run the setup theme command, which will activate your theme and update the seed database

   ```shell
   ./bin/setup-theme
   ```

The site should be up and running with BrowserSync at <http://localhost:3000>, which proxies <http://skela.ups.dock> if you're using Ups Dock, or <http://localhost:8888> if you're not.

To access WP admin, visit `/wp-admin`. The default credentials are `admin` / `password` (configurable via `docker-compose.yml`)

**(Optional)** If you're running an Ups Dock build and you want to re-export the seed database without Ups Dock URLs, run the following command:

```shell
./bin/db-to-no-upsdock
```

### Activating ACF & WP Migrate Plugins (Optional)

If you would like to use the [Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) and [WP Migrate DB Pro](https://deliciousbrains.com/wp-migrate-db-pro/) plugins, follow these steps:

1. Purchase license keys from [ACF](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/#pricing-table) and [WP Migrate DB Pro](https://deliciousbrains.com/wp-migrate-db-pro/pricing/)

2. In `composer.json` add the following to the `"repositories"` array

   ```json
   {
     "type": "composer",
     "url": "https://composer.deliciousbrains.com"
   },
   {
     "type": "package",
     "package": {
       "name": "advanced-custom-fields/advanced-custom-fields-pro",
       "version": "5.12.3",
       "type": "wordpress-plugin",
       "dist": {
         "type": "zip",
         "url": "https://connect.advancedcustomfields.com/index.php?a=download&p=pro&k=ACF_KEY&t=5.12.3"
       }
     }
   },
   ```

3. Replace `ACF_KEY` with your license key

4. Create a file called `auth.json` in the root directory and populate it with your API credentials from [your Account settings page](https://deliciousbrains.com/my-account/settings/)

   ```json
   {
     "http-basic": {
       "composer.deliciousbrains.com": {
         "username": "COMPOSER_API_KEY_USERNAME",
         "password": "COMPOSER_API_KEY_PASSWORD"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

5. In `composer.json` add the following to the `"require"` object

   ```json
   "advanced-custom-fields/advanced-custom-fields-pro": "5.11.1",
   "deliciousbrains-plugin/wp-migrate-db-pro": "^2.2",
   "deliciousbrains-plugin/wp-migrate-db-pro-cli": "^1.6",
   "deliciousbrains-plugin/wp-migrate-db-pro-media-files": "^2.1",
   ```

6. While the container is up, run `./bin/composer update`

## üèÉ‚Äç Development Workflow

1. Run `nvm use` to ensure you're using the correct version of Node

2. Run the start command to start the container and webpack server

   ```shell
   ./bin/start
   ```

3. Visit the localhost URL in your browser

   By default this is <http://localhost:3000/>, which proxies your project's Ups Dock URL (i.e. <http://skela.ups.dock>)

4. Access the WP Admin Dashboard at `/wp-admin` (i.e. <http://skela.ups.dock/wp-admin>)

To shut down the container and development server, type `Ctrl+C`

### Debugging

<https://timber.github.io/docs/guides/debugging/#enable-debugging>

#### Twig Functions

In twig files, there are two common function you can use to print variables to the page: `dump()` and `print_r`.

```html
<pre>
  {{ dump(your_variable) }}
</pre>

{{ your_variable | print_r }}
```

#### Error Logs

The gitignored `logs/error.log` file is a good place to look when hitting ‚Äúcritical error‚Äù screens during development. You can print to them using the `error_log` function, and can track updates to them in realtime using the following command:

```shell
./bin/logs
```

#### Debug Bar & Timber Debug Bar Plugins

For more in-depth information like showing query, cache, and other helpful debugging information, this repository includes the [Debug Bar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/debug-bar/) and [Timber Debug Bar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/debug-bar-timber/) plugins.

### Common `wp-cli` commands

If you've installed this theme using Ups Dock, you can use [WP CLI](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/cli/) with the [`wp` script](/blob/main/bin/wp).

Start the Docker containers with `./bin/start` and then run any of the following commands in a separate shell:

```shell
./bin/wp [command]
```

To update the local WordPress version:

```shell
./bin/wp core update
```

To export the database:

```shell
./bin/wp db export - > docker/conf/mysql/init-ups-dock.sql
```

To export the database and gzip it:

```shell
./bin/wp db export - | gzip -3 > docker/conf/mysql/init-ups-dock.sql.gz
```

To SSH into the WordPress container:

```shell
docker-compose exec wordpress /bin/bash
```

## üöÄ Deployment

When creating a deployment, we recommend generating a new release for your project with an appropriate version bump to the theme's version. This will help facilitate cache-busting for static assets, which receive the theme's version as a query string appended to the end of the path.

You can use the following script to bump the version numbers in this project's `package.json` and the theme's `style.css` (which is where the theme pulls the canonical version from):

```sh
./bin/versionbump [<newversionnumber> | major | minor | patch | premajor | preminor | prepatch | prerelease]
```

By default, running the script with no arguments will result in a patch version bump (so, from `1.0.1` to `1.0.2`). The script utilizes [`npm-version`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-version) behind the scenes to define the new version number; see [those docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-version) for more information on the available version options.

## üîÑ Object-Oriented Approach

This theme utilizes repositories, managers, services and models for a very object-oriented approach to organizing your WordPress data.

### Managers

Managers do things like:

- set up your theme (register option pages, hide dashboard widgets, enqueue JS and CSS, etc.)
- create custom post types and taxonomies
- set up basic WordPress defaults

### Models

Models hold and extend your data.

Have a press release post type that needs a bunch of extra functions? Create a class for them (extending `Timber\Post`) and put your logic there so you can keep your Twig clean!

### Repositories

Repositories are a good place to put query related logic.

It could be used in situations like the following:

> Let get me all the posts from September in the hot dog category!

### Services

Services are for more low-lying functions, like routing.

## üì∞ Gutenberg

This theme has built-in support for easily creating custom Gutenberg blocks with the help of Advanced Custom Fields. Note that the pro version of ACF is required for this.

There is an example custom block under `src/Blocks/SampleACFBlock/ACFBlock.php`. This demonstrates creating a block using ACF functions that includes two fields. Those fields are rendered in the file `templates/components/acf-block.twig`.

Note that in order to get this example to work, you need to create a ACF field group containing two fields, `some_headline` and `some_text`, and then have the field group displayed if the block is equal to ACF block.

Read more details on [creating Gutenberg blocks using ACF](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/blocks/)

### Creating Custom ACF Blocks

1. Create a new ACF block class file in `/src/Blocks`.

   There is an example custom block under `src/Blocks/SampleACFBlock/ACFBlock.php`. This demonstrates creating a block using ACF functions that includes two fields.

   > Note that in order to get this example to work, you need to create an ACF field group containing two fields, `some_headline` and `some_text`, and then have the field group displayed if the block is equal to ACF Block. Be sure to keep your block name all lowercase. ACF drops all uppercase letters and your block might not appear as an option if the names are mismatched.

2. Create a new twig file to render the ACF fields.

   The example block fields are rendered in the file `templates/components/acf-block.twig`.

3. Invoke the ACF block class in `/src/Blocks/Blocks.php`.

4. Add your new Gutenberg block to the array returned in the `allowBlocks` function in `/src/Managers/GutenbergManager.php`.

   ```php
    public function allowBlocks($allowed_blocks)
    {
        return array(
            ...
            'acf/acf-block',
            ...
        );
    }
   ```

Read more about [creating Gutenberg blocks using ACF](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/blocks/)

### Included Custom Blocks

Two custom Gutenberg blocks are included:

- Related Articles
- Image Layout

These include basic styles so they can work out of the box. They _require_ the Advanced Custom Field plugin to function. If you do not plan to use ACF, you can disable these blocks by removing the applicable lines in the constructor function of `/src/Blocks/Blocks.php`

These fields are managed using PHP in the file `/src/Managers/ACFManager.php`. You can make updates to the fields here. If you would rather using the ACF to make updates to these fields:

1. Under `Advanced Custom Fields -> Tools`, import the JSON file in `/gutenberg-acf-backups/`
2. Make updates to the fields
3. Go to `Advanced Custom Fields -> Tools` and generate the PHP code
4. Update the PHP code in `/src/Managers/ACFManager.php`. Make sure to only update the PHP code for one layout group at a time, as they are separated by function in the manager file.

## ‚ôø Accessibility Testing

[Pa11y](https://pa11y.org/) is an automated tool that audits our website's pages for accessibility issues according to [WCAG 2.1 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) standards. This tool captures machine detectable errors such as missing alt text, wrong heading order, browser errors, etc. For issues such as color contrast, keyboard navigation, or VoiceOver functionality, manual testing is advised.

To run the tests, run the following command:

```sh
npm run test:a11y <url>
```

where `<url>` is a valid URL, or one of `local`, `staging` or `live`. Running the command without specifying the url will default to `local`.

### Configuring pa11y

The `package.json` file has preset configurations for pa11y under `testing.accessibility`.

- `paths` (array): Paths appended to the specified URL.
- `ignore.codes` (array): WCAG codes to ignore
- `ignore.selectors` (array): CSS selectors to ignore

## üåê Configuring Multisite

You can configure your install for multisite by setting the following environment variables in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  wordpress:
    environment:
      ...

      # Configure WordPress for multisite
      WORDPRESS_MULTISITE: 1

      # Configure for subdomain routing
      # Leave this commented out for subdirectory routing
      # WORDPRESS_MULTISITE_SUBDOMAIN_INSTALL: 1

      ...
```

This can be done at anytime - before initial install or to convert an existing single site install to multisite. Note that if you are converting from single site to multisite you will need to restart your server with `./bin/start` in order for the change to take effect.

### For Subdomain

By default, multisite is configured to run in subdirectory mode:

```text
skela.ups.dock/site-1
skela.ups.dock/site-2
```

If you are using Ups Dock, you can also configure it to run in subdomain mode with a few extra steps:

```text
site-1.skela.ups.dock
site-2.skela.ups.dock
```

1. Uncomment the following environment variable in `docker-compose.yml`

   ```yaml
   WORDPRESS_MULTISITE_SUBDOMAIN_INSTALL: 1
   ```

2. Update your `VIRTUAL_HOST` environment variable in `docker-compose.ups-dock.yml`

   For subdomain mode to work, you need to tell Ups Dock to route all subdomains of `skela.ups.dock` to this container:

   ```yaml
   VIRTUAL_HOST: skela.ups.dock,*.skela.ups.dock
   ```

3. Update the SSL certificates generated by Ups Dock to include your four level subdomains

   a. Navigate to your local copy of [Ups Dock](https://github.com/Upstatement/ups-dock)

   ```shell
   cd path/to/ups-dock
   ```

   b. Add your wildcard domain to the `[ alternate_names ]` section in `config/openssl.conf`

   ```text
   DNS.1 = ups.dock
   DNS.2 = *.ups.dock
   DNS.3 = *.skela.ups.dock
   ```

   c. Regenerate certs and restart Ups Dock

   ```shell
   ./bin/gen-certs.sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

### Caveats

- Subdomain installs won't work without Ups Dock (or another tool that allows you to map domains to Docker containers) as it will not work when your base domain is `localhost`

For more details about everything these config vars do under the surface, consult [MULTISITE.md](multisite.md).
